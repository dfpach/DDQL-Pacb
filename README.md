# DDQL-Pacb
Double Deep Q-Learning Implementation for access control through Pacb adaptation in cellular networks

The MATLAB file entrenaDDQL1diaexp1.zip contains the first 200 results from the DDQL solution trained with 1 day of data and using a neural network with 10 hidden layers. These results were part of the journal paper "Deep reinforcement learning mechanism for dynamic access control in wireless networks handling mMTC" D. Pacheco-Paramo, L. Tello-Oquendo, V. Pla, J. Martinez Bauset. Ad Hoc Networks, November 2019.
